It is possible to add merchant payments to an application, by making a call to the merchant payment service. You may add any amount of payment that is `>0`, as the system does not consider a payment of 0p to be a payment.

--- | --- | --- | ---
`$.amount` | Yes | int | Payment amount in *pence* (must be `>0`)
`$.effective_date` | Yes | string (ISO8601 Formatted date) | e.g '2016-12-31'

#### Example
To send a payment request for Â£9.99 (999 pence) to be effective on the 23 June 2016 you would send the following payload.

```json
{
    "amount": 999,
    "effective_date": "2016-06-23"
}
```

#### Response

Returns a `204 No Content` status.
