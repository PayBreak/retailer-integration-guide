### Set Product Order

Sets the order for products specified in the request body for a given installation.This API will sort product call APIs which list ungrouped products by its order value in `descending` order.

- Any product not assigned an order value or given an order value of `null` will be moved to the bottom of the list and will then be sorted by the default ordering scheme, which is product id in `descending` order.

- Assigning an order value to a product that already has an order value will overwrite its existing value.

- Assigning an order value of `null` to a product will remove its order value.

```
