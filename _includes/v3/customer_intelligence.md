# Customer Intelligence 
 
Customer Intelligence is a suite of products available which allows customers to establish their eligibility for finance and potential credit limits without adversely impacting their credit file. This option needs to be activated on your account to be utilised, please speak to your Account Manager for more details.
 
The customer will complete the required fields before submitting in order to obtain a Green, Amber or Red outcome. The Green outcome also displays potential credit limits per available finance products. Customer information captured during customer intelligence can be displayed throughout the journey and pre populated on the etika loan application for a smooth customer experience.
 
The Customer Intelligence suite can be integrated via etika's widget or API. More information on this is available within the [Test Environment](#test-environment) and [Customer Intelligence](api/#customer-intelligence) sections.
